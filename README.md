# Needless to Create?

This web application was part of the Next Level Week, a free event done by Rocketseat.

It's completely defined to be a podcast site, in which you can make most of what you want to listen.
The complete coding is done with Typescript, and was chosen this way for the reason of understanding erros and handling with them with the "language"!

Some packages were added to the Next App: rc-slider, typescript by itself (as the project comes in JS), axios (we use a local server), date-fns for dates and scss, noy only CSS this time!

# Can I run it?

![HowTo](https://github.com/sergioneto12/Podcaster-NLW05/blob/main/HowTo.png)

You can! But first: 
******* make sure you have 2 terminals, the ones you want.

At your first, you type "yarn server" to get the intern server running.
After that, on the other hand (;D) you type "yarn start" to see the magic happens!

# Depolyed?

This project will be a base to many experiments and to other coming project, so now, it won't get deployed...
